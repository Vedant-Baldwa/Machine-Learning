# Machine-Learning
This repository is a collection of my machine learning projects, experiments, and research notebooks — built from Kaggle competitions, personal explorations, and real-world problem-solving.
It includes end-to-end model implementations, performance evaluations, and notes on ML concepts and best practices.

I’m continuously improving these models and notes.
If you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or reach out!
